# YouTube Dislike

On **2021-Nov-11** YouTube made the dislike count and like/dislike ratio
private.

I **disliked** it, pun intended ;). So I did what any programmer would do, write a code to
achieve what I **like** :)

A detailed guide, for why and how I did this can be found on my
[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/FKnight/), here's the
[link to the video](https://youtu.be/1uAH93tzfQY)

I'll see y'll soon :)

## What this does

This is a code, which comment on all of your own videos, with the basic information; such as
**likes**, **dislikes**, **like to dislike ratio** & **date on which this data was fetched on**.
Basically all the details which YT made private.

## TODO

- How to pin this comment (need help)
